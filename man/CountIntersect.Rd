\title{
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
Find and Count Repeat Elements Overlapping with Genomic Intervals

}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
Using a narrowPeak, broadPeak, or summits file obtained via MACS 2 and annotated via ChIPseeker, and a RepeatMasker file, aggregates repeat types, families and classes intersecting with the intervals in the peak file.
}
\usage{
CountIntersect(repeatMaskerFile, inputPeakFile, format, minoverlap = 0L)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{repeatMaskerFile}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{repeatMaskerFile} here~~
data frame containing repeat information, generated via \link{read_rm}.
}
  \item{inputPeakFile}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{inputPeakFile} here~~
data frame containing peak intervals and annotation.
}
  \item{format}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{format} here~~
character vector identifying peak file format, one of "narrow", "broad", or "summit", corresponding to ".narrowPeak", ".broadPeak", and "summits.bed" files generated by MACS2, respectively.
}
  \item{minoverlap}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{minoverlap} here~~
integer identifying minimum number of overlapping bases between "broad" peak and repeat intervals. Is not called if the format argument is "narrow" or "summit".
}

\value{
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use

%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
%% ...
A list with three components.
  \item{RepeatName}{A tibble with two columns, respectively showing the repeat name and the count of instances intersecting with input peaks.}
  \item{RepeatFamily}{A tibble with two columns, respectively showing the repeat family and the count of instances intersecting with input peaks.}
  \item{RepeatClass}{A tibble with two columns, respectively showing the repeat class and the count of instances intersecting with input peaks.}
